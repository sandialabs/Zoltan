The design of general-purpose dynamic load-balancing tools for parallel
applications is more challenging than the design of static partitioning tools.
Both algorithmic and software engineering issues arise. We have addressed many
of these issues in the design of the Zoltan dynamic load-balancing library.
Zoltan has an object-oriented interface that makes it easy to use and provides
separation between the application and the load-balancing algorithms. It
contains a suite of dynamic load-balancing algorithms, including both
geometric and graph-based algorithms. Its design makes it valuable both as a
partitioning tool for a variety of applications and as a research test-bed for
new algorithmic development. In this paper, we describe Zoltan's design and
demonstrate its use in an unstructured-mesh finite element application.
